Wolfbanejackal: it slumbers in the mire<br />

Wolfbanejackal: no foragers will find their treasure here.<br />

Wolfbanejackal: though his lip quivers, he remains steadfast<br />
Wolfbanejackal: his weapon raised, he hollers in anger<br />
Wolfbanejackal: his quarry bursts forth, snarling and ready to <b>devour!</b><br />
Wolfbanejackal: KA-BOOM!<br />
Wolfbanejackal: the dirt splashes with a THUD<br />
Wolfbanejackal: he yells with joy, and returns home.<br />

            &emsp;&emsp;There once was a warrior, full of great pain and suffering. He traveled the lands, in search for hope, joy, mirth, in others, so that he might one day learn to rid himself of his agony. Each land he came to was desolate, ravaged by the Demon-Dragon Malora. Only few people remained, and even they had no desire to rebuild, to seek happiness. Their souls were consumed by the sadness left behind by the monster's destruction.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;The warrior was immune to the marring effects of Malora's soul poison, and so with great effort, he helped each community he visited. In the center of the lands, far from civilization, there was a wishing fountain full of a youthful blue liquid that flowed indefinitely. This fountain was like a home to the warrior; he had spent many moons there trying to wash away his anguish in vain. Knowing this magical water would never be able to break his curse, he brought it to settlements ruined by the dragon.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;Though he was kind and benevolent to these citizens, they despised him. They knew of what he had done, and they hated him for it. The fountain's water had cleansed the peoples' souls of their curse, but their minds and hearts were still imprisoned by contempt for this man and his horrific past.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;One day, after the warrior had had enough of the people's hate, he traveled far across the lands to speak with Malora, who had afflicted him with this curse upon him years ago.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;"Malora!" the warrior called up to the massive, ancient behemoth.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;"Why must I live like this? Is there no way to break this curse?"<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;She looked down upon him, and said, "Before I cursed you, you were the most frightening and gruesome swordsman to mar this world. You would kill anyone, anything standing in your path, just because you loved it."<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;"By cursing you, I took away your lust for killing, and in its stead, bestowed unto you the agony of every life you've taken away. I can't have someone as dangerous as you ruining all my fun, now can I?"<br />

            &emsp;&emsp;Long ago, in the medieval city of Krongstadd, there was a worthy and glorious paladin. He was born from unknown parents and in an unknown land, he had come to Krongstadd as a boy, and joined their militia. He trained and trained; he became the perfect soldier. Then he found God, who has shown him his way to enlightenment, and he became the perfect warrior. He was unstoppable, no man nor demon could best him. <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;But one day, a cloaked man shrowded in shadows and armor as black as night arrived at Krongstadd and mercilessly slaughtered an innocent family. The paladin heard of this, and challenged the black knight to a duel on the roof of the keep, the next day at noon. When that time came, the warriors met, one shining with the glory of god, and the other cursed with the blight of night.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;A large group of commonfolk arrived to watch the duel. Both warriors unsheathed their weapons, they circled each other for a short time and then lunged into battle with one another. They soon learned how perfect the other warrior was. They fought and fought, and yet could not best each other. Both knew every style of slash, parry, strike, counter, stab, and block. Every single move in a swordfight was known by both of these warriors; they could accurately predict each other's next move instantly, yet neither could best their opponent.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;Determined as the warriors were, they continued combat into the next day. The onlookers grew tired, even with the amazing action these two skillfull warriors displayed. These two fighters, locked in timeless combat, eventually became a landmark of the city of Krongstadd. Bets were originally wagered, higher and higher on these combatants, but they were forgotten as time went on and the battle continued. Seasons passed. Years went by. Entire generations came and went.<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;Until one fateful day, when only a few were watching (as many did as a daily practice): the glorious paladin slipped on stone, and the dark knight slid his sword through his opponent's chest. The paladin fell upon the stone floor, and the black knight, only mildly exhausted from his venture, turned and left the city, never to be seen again. The residents of Krongstadd took this as a terrible omen; as they had come to view the two duelists as a part of life. Bad times were upon them, and they knew it.
